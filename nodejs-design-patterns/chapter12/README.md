# Chapter 12: Scalability and Architectural Patterns

When JavaScript was created, it was perfect for distributed systems because of its non-blocking behavior. Ranging from a few nodes to thousands, communicating with each other over the network.

NodeJS is single-threaded, so it might not utilize all the capacity of multi-core machine, but this is one side of coin. In reality, scalability doesnâ€™t only refer to increasing capacity of machine and handling more requests faster, but also high availability, and fault-tolerance. Breaking the code in multiple components can also be considered as scalability strategy in terms of development.

Because NodeJS is single-threaded, the only way to scale it is to distribute it over multiple instances and machines. But with this, we also get higher availability and fault tolerance of the application.
