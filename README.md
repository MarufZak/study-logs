# Study Logs

A repository to document my learning journey through various courses and books. Each folder contains my notes, observations, and insights from different resources.

## Overview

This repository serves as a personal knowledge base, capturing the essence of my learning process and understanding of different concepts. It includes detailed notes, summaries, and sometimes exercises from various resources, such as books and courses. The goal is to create a comprehensive collection of study logs that can be referenced in the future and shared with others.

## Structure

The repository is organized into different folders, each representing a specific topic or course. Here's a brief overview of the current structure:

- **`typescript-essentials`** — My notes and takeaways from the TotalTypeScript Pro Essentials workshop by Matt Pocock.
- **`nodejs-design-patterns`** — My notes and takeaways from the NodeJS Design Patterns book by Mario Casciaro and Luciano Mammino.

> **Note**: This list will grow as I continue my learning journey. Feel free to explore the folders to see detailed notes on each subject. If anything is unclear or you have questions, feel free to open an issue or reach out to me directly.
