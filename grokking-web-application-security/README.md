## Know your enemy

Hackers can be divided into 2 groups: _black hat_ hackers, and _white hat_ hackers. Black hat hackers attack our application for financial or political reasons, but white hat hackers attack in order to report security vulnerabilities, before black hat hackers make use of it. White hat hackers leaded to _grey hat_ hackers, who find security vulnerabilities, report, and get paid. Also named bug bounties.

Hackers use automated software and tools. Commonly used is _Linux Kali_, Linux distro including many hacking tools.

White hat hackers also include security researchers. They find the vulnerability, report and demonstrate the exploit to the creators, and when patch version is published, the vulnerability is published in _common vulnerability and exposure (CVE)_ database. Such exploits are encorporated to tools like Metasploit.
