## extract members of discrimination unions

- Task
  Extract the the member of discrimination union, so the test cases pass.

  ```tsx
  import type { Equal, Expect } from "@total-typescript/helpers";

  export type Event =
    | {
        type: "click";
        event: MouseEvent;
      }
    | {
        type: "focus";
        event: FocusEvent;
      }
    | {
        type: "keydown";
        event: KeyboardEvent;
      };

  type ClickEvent = unknown;

  type tests = Expect<Equal<ClickEvent, { type: "click"; event: MouseEvent }>>;
  ```

- Solution

  ```tsx
  type ClickEvent = Extract<Event, { type: "click" }>;
  ```

## excluding members of discrimination unions

- Task
  Exclude member of discrimination union so the test cases pass.

  ```tsx
  import type { Equal, Expect } from "@total-typescript/helpers";

  export type Event =
    | {
        type: "click";
        event: MouseEvent;
      }
    | {
        type: "focus";
        event: FocusEvent;
      }
    | {
        type: "keydown";
        event: KeyboardEvent;
      };

  type NonKeyDownEvents = unknown;
  ```

- Solution

  ```tsx
  import type { Equal, Expect } from "@total-typescript/helpers";

  export type Event =
    | {
        type: "click";
        event: MouseEvent;
      }
    | {
        type: "focus";
        event: FocusEvent;
      }
    | {
        type: "keydown";
        event: KeyboardEvent;
      };

  type NonKeyDownEvents = Exclude<Event, { type: "keydown" }>;

  type test = Expect<
    Equal<
      NonKeyDownEvents,
      | {
          type: "click";
          event: MouseEvent;
        }
      | {
          type: "focus";
          event: FocusEvent;
        }
    >
  >;
  ```

## union types in js

From the perspective of TypeScript, we don't know which value the union is, we can just pretend that it's both. And if it is both, it means that everything that you do with the value needs to be evaluated for all possible code paths that you are defining. Thatâ€™s like multiverses you define, and you handle the cases for its branches. These branches can have more branches until you end up with a very complex set of different possibilities.

## indexed access with arrays

We can index access the values of an array, where put the numbers as keys.

- Example

  ```tsx
  const array = ["apple", "banana"] as const;

  type AppleOrBanana = (typeof array)[0 | 1]; // apple | banana
  // or
  type AppleOrBanana = (typeof array)[number]; // apple | banana
  ```

## combining unions in template literal types

If we combine strings in template literal types, we can get union of all combinations of these strings.

- Example

  ```tsx
  type BreadType = "rye" | "brown" | "white";
  type Filling = "cheese" | "ham" | "salami";

  type Sandwich = `${BreadType} with ${Filling}`;
  // "rye with cheese" | "rye with ham" | "rye with salami" |
  // "brown with cheese" | "brown with ham" | "brown with salami" |
  // "white with cheese" | "white with ham" | "white with salami"
  ```
