# NOTES

1. Stable algorithm - guarantees that the relative order of equal elements in the input will be the same as in the output.

2. Adaptive algorithm - the time complexity of the algorithm depends on the input. If the input is let's say already sorted, then algorithm will take N length to complete. If not, it performs all the steps acting like algorithm is not sorted (even if it is).

3. Divide and conquer. Algorithm technique used to solve problems by breaking them into smaller and more manageable sub-problems. It consists of 3 steps:
   1. Divide. Recursive division the initial problem in order to simplify it.
   2. Conquer. Solve each sub-problem independently, with the same algorithm for each.
