## Introduction

Linux is a member of large family of Unix-like operating systems. Became popular in 1990s, initially developed by Linus Torvalds in 1991 as OS for IBM-compatible personal computers. Over the years Linux is being developed by many developers, and Linux is now available for many archs, for example AMD64, Intel’s Itanium and others.

Linux kernel is true Unix Kernel, but not full Unix OS, because it doesn’t include Unix applications, such as file system utils, system admin commands, compilers, text editors and others. But they can be freely downloaded.

Source code for Linux kernel is contained in more than 14.000 C and Assembly files, having over 6 millions lines of code and taking over 230 MB of disk space.

Linux kernel has similarities on architecture compared to other Unix-like kernels, because they share fundamental design ideas and features.

Linux kernel is compliant with IEEE POSIX standard, making it possible for other Unix programs to be compiled and executed on Linux with little or no efforts.
