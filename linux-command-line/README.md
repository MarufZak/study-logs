These days companies decide on what users can or can't do with their computers. It's taking freedom out of the users. Linux is going the opposite way, it is giving the freedom. And freedom means knowing and deciding what is exactly happening in your computer.

While GUI makes easy tasks easy, CLI makes difficult tasks possible. Because Linux is modeled after Unix, it has same CLI utilities. And because Unix was first developed long before GUI, it has very extensible list of CLI utilities.

GNU has big impact on Linux, as Linux is the name of kernel, and it cannot be the whole system on its own. GNU provided essential operating system components such as core utilities, built tools, editors, etc. That's why some refer to Linux as GNU/Linux.
