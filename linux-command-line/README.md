# Linux Command Line

My notes and takeaways from the Linux Command Line book.

These days companies decide on what users can or can't do with their computers. It's taking freedom out of the users. Linux is going the opposite way, it is giving the freedom. And freedom means knowing and deciding what is exactly happening in your computer.

While GUI makes easy tasks easy, CLI makes difficult tasks possible. Because Linux is modeled after Unix, it has same CLI utilities. And because Unix was first developed long before GUI, it has very extensible list of CLI utilities.

GNU has big impact on Linux, as Linux is the name of kernel, and it cannot be the whole system on its own. GNU provided essential operating system components such as core utilities, built tools, editors, etc. That's why some refer to Linux as GNU/Linux.

## Part 1, learning the shell

Shell is a program that takes the commands we enter and give to operating system to carry out. Most Linux distributions supply `bash` shell program, which is enhanced version of `sh`, original shell program for Unix.

When using GUI, we need another interface to write commands, it's called terminal emulator. Once we start it, prompt is shown, usually prepended by username, machine name, and current directory. If it ends with `$` sign, it means we are regular user, if with `#`, it means we are root user.

Command history is remembered, usually up to 500 commands.

Basic commands like `date`, `cal`, `free`, `df`

Linux has one filesystem, while Windows uses separate file systems for each device mounted to it. Filesystem is structured as tree-like structure. Basic commands include `ls`, `pwd`, 'cd'.

Most top-level folder is root folder, and can be accessed with `cd /`. Each user has own directory, called home directory, can be accessed with `cd`.

- Linux has no concept of file extension, and content type is determined other way. It uses magic numbers (special bytes patterns at the start of the file, there is `file` command for this too). Though some applications might use its extension to determine the contents.
- In Linux the files are case-sensitive.
- Although many characters are allowed, use dash, dot, or \_ to make a space in filenames, instead of using spaces or other characters. Using spaces makes navigation commands much more harder.
